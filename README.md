# OpenSat
OpenSat is an open-source project dedicated to the development of cubesats, which are miniaturized satellites designed to be cost-effective and relatively easy to build and launch. The main idea behind OpenSat is to democratize access to space, making the design, construction, and implementation of satellites more accessible.
